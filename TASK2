In this segment, I would like to extend my warm greetings to the audience and welcome them to another informative video. Today's video is a continuation of the previous one, which constituted Part One of the KPMG virtual internship. If you haven't watched the previous video yet, I highly recommend doing so to get a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing project. You can find the link in the description box below or simply click on the top right-hand corner of your screen to access Part One.

In this video, our focus will be on the second task, which involves data insights aimed at identifying high-value customers. To save time, I have already analyzed the data and made preparations beforehand.

The task requirements involve three main deliverables: data exploration, model development, and model evaluation. We will be working with three datasets: customer demographic, customer address, and transactions data. These datasets serve as the foundation for our analysis.

For a more structured approach, we will be following the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process, which consists of seven key steps: data gathering, data cleaning, data transformation, data modeling, data evaluation, model deployment, and knowledge interpretation.

To begin, we have created two new columns in the transactions dataset: "Age" and "Profit." Age is derived from the date of birth, while Profit is calculated as the difference between list price and standard cost. We have also merged the three datasets using the customer ID as a primary key.

Next, we perform an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their behavior and value to the business. This analysis helps us target high-value customers more effectively.

Additionally, we have conducted an analysis on age clusters and profitability, which provides insights into which age groups contribute the most to profit. Moreover, we have examined car ownership and bike-related purchases across different states and industries.

The next steps involve creating charts to compare old and new customer lists, followed by developing a PowerPoint presentation to showcase our data insights. Task Three will entail creating dynamic dashboards using Google Studios.

I hope this video has been helpful, and I encourage you to watch the next one where we delve into creating powerful dashboards. Thank you for staying till the end, and I look forward to sharing more valuable content in my upcoming videos. Keep learning and sharing knowledge. Thank you and goodbye.
