# KPMG-VIRTUAL-INTERNSHIP


**Background Information**

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized company specializing in bicycles and cycling accessories, operates in Australia. Their main area of concern revolves around their customer and transactional data. Although they possess a substantial dataset concerning their customers, the company's team is uncertain about the most effective way to analyze this data to enhance their marketing strategy and achieve optimization.

The client furnished KPMG with three distinct datasets, namely:

Customer Demographic

Customer Addresses

Transactions data covering the past three months

As part of my participation in the KPMG data analytics virtual internship program, I undertook the role of a Data Analyst and completed three specific tasks related to these datasets.

**Data Quality Evaluation:** Evaluating the quality and completeness of the data in readiness for analysis.

**Data Analysis:** Identifying high-value customers by analyzing customer demographics and attributes.

**Data Visualization and Presentation:** Utilizing visual representations to communicate and showcase the data insight.
